## STORY
The ghost is something very threatening, except on Halloween day. Therefore, let’s take advantage of this event to hang out with it. However, DO NOT FORGET: besides the cute ghost, we also may face a lot of other scary ghosts, who will put an end to the whole fun.


## WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO?
You simply have to help the little ghost to avoid scary ghosts on the way. Each time you overcome a scary ghost, you get a bonus score - try to have the highest score possible every time you play.

##INSPIRATION
The main character of this game - the little ghost - represents a child, who always wants to go out to play, but is scared of many dangerous things outside. Therefore, our main subject for this game is all children, to inspire them to be more courageous to discover the world.

It does not mean this game is not for grown-ups. Our goal is to create a game that everyone can easily access and play to enjoy their Halloween day. With cute things, funny background music, and vivid colors, we hope people will have a fun time playing this game.

## How we built it
The game building is divided into two parts:
1. Programming: We simultaneously use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to code this game and GoDaddy to upload the game on the website.

2.Designing: We use Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop to design objects and the background, GifMaker.me to create animation, and Canva to create the video.

## Challenges we ran into
The first challenge is about brainstorming ideas. To reach a common agreement about the character, we had to discuss and reject a lot of ideas, and fortunately, we finally found the "little ghost".
The next one is about hosting. This is also the first time we have hosted a domain. We are very confused about how to configure the DNS and name the domain. But we have figured it out and solved all the problems.

Last but not least, we have a problem with creating a start-over pop-up for this game. We still reached a deadlock. After all, we figured out an alternative solution that is to click "Play Again" and restart the program.

In just nearly 40 hours, we have met so many challenges and overcome most of those. That is what brings us many exciting moments, new knowledge and precious experience.


## What we learned
By finishing the game, we had have learned many things in creating web game, including:
Building games using JavaScipts
Learn to use GitHub Pages and GoDaddy
Apply Design tools into building games
Better understanding of web games
Team Working in a Hackathon!
